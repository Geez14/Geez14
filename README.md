### Hi, I'm Monabbar Anjum
* ðŸ’» I've been coding in Java, Python for over 2 years
* ðŸ¤– I'm learning AI/ML at the moment

I've been enjoying web development for the first time ever since I built my first API from scratch in Java, just using socket programming. The structure and documentation make me wat to leave the JavaScript ecosystem behind for good.

I'm currently on the look out for a role in backed web development, Ideally writing Java, Python. I'd love to work at a startup to gain skill apart from coding like management skills.
